# Code for: Dynamic Pricing of Traffic Data: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach

This repository contains the Python code implementing the dynamic pricing framework for traffic data as described in the paper **"[Your Paper Title Here: Dynamic Pricing of Traffic Data: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach]"** (Replace with the actual paper title and add a link if available).

## Experimental 1 Synthetic Experiment Overview

This code provides a practical implementation of a dynamic pricing strategy for traffic data. It incorporates several key components:

* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creates a realistic-like traffic data stream.
* **Spatiotemporal Data Valuation:** Implements a model to assess the value of traffic data based on temporal and spatial factors.
* **Demand Prediction:** Utilizes a simple linear regression model to forecast the demand for traffic data.
* **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Employs the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library to find optimal pricing strategies by considering multiple objectives such as revenue, user cost, data quality, and price fairness.
* **Dynamic Pricing Application:** Applies the optimized price factors to the traffic data.
* **Visualization:** Generates charts to visualize the dynamic pricing results alongside traffic speed and volume.

This implementation serves as a demonstration and a starting point for further research and development in the area of dynamic traffic data pricing.

## Key Features

* **End-to-end Dynamic Pricing Framework:**  Covers data acquisition, valuation, demand prediction, optimization, and pricing.
* **Multi-Objective Optimization using DEAP:**  Leverages a powerful evolutionary computation library.
* **Modular Design:**  The code is structured into functions for easy understanding and modification.
* **Visualization of Results:** Provides visual insights into the impact of dynamic pricing.

## Relationship to the Paper

This code directly implements the concepts and methodologies discussed in the paper **"[Your Paper Title Here: Dynamic Pricing of Traffic Data: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach]"**. Specifically:

* **Data Valuation Model:** The `temporal_value`, `spatial_value`, and `quality_factor_calculation` functions implement the spatiotemporal value model described in the paper (likely in a section discussing data valuation).
* **Demand Prediction:** The use of `LinearRegression` corresponds to the demand prediction techniques discussed in the paper.
* **Multi-Objective Optimization with DEAP:** The code utilizes DEAP to perform multi-objective optimization, aiming to balance the objectives outlined in the paper (revenue, cost, quality, fairness).
* **Dynamic Pricing Logic:** The final section of the `run_dynamic_pricing_experiment` function applies the optimized price factors to calculate the dynamic price.

**To fully understand the context and rationale behind this code, please refer to the original paper.**

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You will also need the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* DEAP
* matplotlib
* seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn deap matplotlib seaborn
```

## Code Explanation

The main parts of the code are as follows:

* **`run_dynamic_pricing_experiment()` function:**
    * **Data Acquisition:** Generates a synthetic `pandas` DataFrame representing traffic data with features like timestamp, location, speed, volume, and incidents.
    * **Data Valuation:** Implements the spatiotemporal value model using the `temporal_value`, `spatial_value`, `quality_factor_calculation`, and `calculate_data_value` functions. It calculates a value for each data point based on these factors.
    * **Demand Prediction:** Trains a `LinearRegression` model using `scikit-learn` to predict traffic volume based on the hour of the day and the day of the week.
    * **Multi-Objective Optimization:**
        * Uses the `deap` library to define the fitness function (`evaluate`), individual representation, and optimization operators (mutation, crossover, selection).
        * The `evaluate` function calculates the objectives: revenue, user cost (price), data quality, and a fairness penalty based on the price factor.
        * The `run_optimization` function executes the `eaSimple` algorithm from `deap` to find the best price factor for a given data point.
    * **Dynamic Pricing:** Iterates through the traffic data, runs the optimization for each data point, and applies the resulting optimal price factor to calculate the `dynamic_price`.
* **`visualize_dynamic_pricing()` function:**
    * Takes the DataFrame with dynamic prices as input.
    * Aggregates the data by date and hour to calculate mean prices, speeds, and volumes.
    * Generates a series of subplots using `matplotlib` to visualize the dynamic price, normalized speed, and normalized volume for each day.
    * Saves the visualization as a `dynamic_pricing.pdf` file.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:**
    * Calls the `run_dynamic_pricing_experiment()` function to get the traffic data with dynamic prices.
    * Prints the first few rows of the DataFrame.
    * Calls the `visualize_dynamic_pricing()` function to generate the visualization.

## Usage

After running the `dynamic_pricing.py` script, you will find:

* **Terminal output:** Showing the head of the `traffic_data` DataFrame with the calculated `dynamic_price`.
* **`dynamic_pricing.pdf` file:** Containing the visualizations of the dynamic pricing results.

You can modify the parameters within the script (e.g., the number of generations in the optimization, the parameters of the valuation model) to experiment with different settings and observe their impact on the dynamic pricing outcomes.
