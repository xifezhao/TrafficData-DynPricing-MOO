# Code for: Dynamic Pricing of Traffic Data: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach

This repository contains the Python code implementing the dynamic pricing framework for traffic data as described in the paper **"[Your Paper Title Here: Dynamic Pricing of Traffic Data: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach]"** (Replace with the actual paper title and add a link if available).

## Overview

This code provides a practical implementation of a dynamic pricing strategy for traffic data. It incorporates several key components:

* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creates a realistic-like traffic data stream.
* **Spatiotemporal Data Valuation:** Implements a model to assess the value of traffic data based on temporal and spatial factors.
* **Demand Prediction:** Utilizes a simple linear regression model to forecast the demand for traffic data.
* **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Employs the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library to find optimal pricing strategies by considering multiple objectives such as revenue, user cost, data quality, and price fairness.
* **Dynamic Pricing Application:** Applies the optimized price factors to the traffic data.
* **Visualization:** Generates charts to visualize the dynamic pricing results alongside traffic speed and volume.

This implementation serves as a demonstration and a starting point for further research and development in the area of dynamic traffic data pricing.
